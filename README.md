A minimalistic SSEF Form data parser that promises to keep you occupied while your data is being processed. The entertainment is of course, unfortunately, not yet implemented. You may however use the SSEF form uploader functions.

Please have mySQL installed. The username and password may not match that of yours, following which you will need to modify your code. In future, we will use a web server to host this data so that we will not have to configure local database options.

v0.1:
It works. 

v0.2 (planned):
-Gives you a live weather feed
-Works with a web server.
-Local server option still available, after a prompt for username and password
-Log files for better debugging operations
